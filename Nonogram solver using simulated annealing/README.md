TODO : 
- A solving function (actually it's a file that make a loop).
- Write the README

Since it's using simulated annealing method, it is possible to not obtain the solution, or it can takes a lot of times. 

Also, i need to optimize the code with some C/C++ loops to make it faster when the dimension is growing. 

The plot function has been inspired by coolbutuseless function using ggplot2 (https://github.com/coolbutuseless/nonogram/blob/master/R/plot.R)
